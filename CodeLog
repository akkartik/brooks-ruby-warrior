Copy code from beginner tower.
Trying a warrior that practices avoidance. Infinite loop.

Done with level 3.
Level 4 works with level 3's warrior. But I need to learn how to
systematically capture all the captives, and kill all the hostiles.

Added memory for hostile locations.
But it turns out I need to be able to either approach from a different
direction or find a different target.

More from Feb 10.

A different approach. I'm going to try a layered subsumption architecture like
Rodney Brooks pioneered (MIT AI Memo 864)

Better representation for tracking layers that want to highlight or drop
options.
When intersecting options by different layers we do a combination of min and
max:
  a) if either value is 0, the result drops to zero (min)
  b) if neither value is 0, take the max.
Each level will either set the option to a constant or drop it to zero. Higher
layers will have higher constants. In this way they will take precedence over
the choices of lower layers, but still be subject to their constraints.

Starting level 4 from scratch now. Simplest player: simply choose random
actions to perform.
