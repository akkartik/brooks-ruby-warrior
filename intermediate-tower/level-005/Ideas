The fact that we're spending so much time making level-0 (random) decisions in
the presence of 2 hostiles highlights the hole in our decision space.

Alternatives:
  a) Track bad squares and avoid them.
  b) On bad squares bind other targets and focus on one at a time. Remember bound hostiles from captives.

Ways to break an impasse between layers:
  a) Try juggling the layers around
  b) Create a new 'synthesis' layer
  c) Make lower layers smarter in detecting constraints
     Be careful though; don't make constraints heuristics

Level should be proportional to sophistication, not necessarily weight of the vote.

Reasons to order layers:
  Importance
  Sophistication (using data from lower layers)

We want lower layers to be narrow but have higher weight. And for higher
layers to be more broadly applicable but overrideable by lower layers.

drop vs accentuate
accentuate lower vs higher layers
